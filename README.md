Go: Twitter Streaming API
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JustAdam/streamingtwitter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JustAdam/streamingtwitter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/JustAdam/streamingtwitter/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/JustAdam/streamingtwitter)

Go package to provide access to Twitter's streaming API.

This is a very early version which is no doubt missing lots of functionality (and tests), so just open an issue and/or help out :)

See [streamingapi-client](https://github.com/JustAdam/streamingtwitter-client) for an example client.
